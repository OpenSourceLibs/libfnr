  libFNR - A reference implementation library for FNR encryption scheme.

  FNR represents "Flexible Naor and Reingold" 

  FNR is a small domain block cipher for encrypting
    objects ( < 128 bits ) like IPv4, MAC, Credit Card numbers, Time Stamps etc.

  INSTALL -- 
  NOTE : openssl latest version (> openssl-1.0.1e) needs to be installed

     ./configure --enable-debug=yes
      
      make

   RUN
   
     cd test
   
     ./ipv4test -p password -t  tweak -f rawâ€“ips

  IMPORTANT:  This is an *experimental* cipher, not for production yet.
